This Quick Start assumes familiarity with the SWIFT Connectivity components and software options. SWIFT Connectivity on AWS enables other backend payments applications to interface with the SWIFT network.

<<figure2>> shows components that are out of scope for this deployment:

* This architecture aligns with SWIFT security control 1.1, where it's mandated that connectivity components be located in a secure zone.  
* VPC endpoints provide connectivity to the following AWS security services:
 ** AWS Systems Manager is used to satisfy security controls 2.1, 2.6, 4.2, and 6.4.
 ** Amazon CloudWatch is used to satisfy security control 6.4.
 ** AWS Secrets Manager is used to satisfy security controls 2.1, 4.1, and 5.4.
* AMH integrates into the SWIFT product portfolio by providing an abstraction layer for messaging and routing.  
* SAG is a communication interface that connects to SWIFT via a single instance of SNL. 
* AWS Direct Connect is used to connect to the SWIFT network, which, with a colocation site (that is, Interxion), hosts the SWIFT HSM for message signing and VPN devices for securing connectivity to Backbone Access Points (BAP).
* HSM device in the Interxion data center is remotely managed by Exceet.
* A BAP is an entry point to the SWIFT network.
