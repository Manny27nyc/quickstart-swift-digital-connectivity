AWS compliance measures help to streamline, automate, and implement security baselines
 on the AWS Cloud, from initial design to operational security readiness. This Quick Start includes link:../assets/SWIFT-CSP-Security-Controls-public.xlsx[SWIFT CSP Security Controls^], which map to architecture decisions, features, and configuration baselines. 

The customer is responsible for deployment and management.
